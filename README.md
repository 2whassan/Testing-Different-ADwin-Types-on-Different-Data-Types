# Testing-Different-ADwin-Types-on-Different-Data-Types
In this project, We are testing different types of ADwins (Original, Serial, HalfCut, and SnapShot) on different types of data.
The data types are generated like (Incremental, Gradual, Abrupt, Outlier, and Constant) and real-life called DEBSGC. We are comparing each type of ADwin to the Original ADwin type. We are taking the Original ADwin as our reference (the ground truth).

The orignial implementation is: https://github.com/TU-Berlin-DIMA/parallel-ADWIN
